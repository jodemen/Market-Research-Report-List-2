<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Phase Voltage Controller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Phase Half-wave Voltage Controller</li><li>Single-Phase Full-wave Voltage Controller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-Phase Half-wave Voltage Controller: This type of voltage controller allows current to flow through the load for only half of each cycle, resulting in an output voltage that is pulsating. It is simple and cost-effective but provides lower efficiency.</p><p>Single-Phase Full-wave Voltage Controller: In contrast, this type of controller allows current to flow through the load for the entire cycle, resulting in a more stable and smooth output voltage. It provides better efficiency and is suitable for applications requiring constant voltage control.</p></p>
