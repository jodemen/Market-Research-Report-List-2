<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Centrifugal Compressors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC compressors are essential components in air conditioning systems. Positive displacement compressors work by trapping air in a chamber and reducing its volume to increase its pressure. They are ideal for applications requiring high pressure ratios. Centrifugal compressors, on the other hand, use a rotating impeller to accelerate air and convert kinetic energy into pressure. They are more suitable for high volume, low-pressure applications. Both types have their specific uses in the AC compressor market, catering to different requirements and operating conditions.</p></p>
