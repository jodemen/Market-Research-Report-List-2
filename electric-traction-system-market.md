<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Traction System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alternating Current Supply</li><li>Direct Current Supply</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric traction systems are used to power trains, trams, and other forms of transportation. Two main types of traction systems are alternating current (AC) supply and direct current (DC) supply. </p><p>AC supply systems use overhead wires to distribute electricity to the trains, while DC supply systems use a third rail or overhead wire. AC systems are more commonly used for long-distance high-speed trains, while DC systems are more common for urban and suburban rail networks. Both systems have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the transportation network.</p></p>
