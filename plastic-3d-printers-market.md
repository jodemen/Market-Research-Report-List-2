<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic 3D Printers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FDM Thermoplastic</li><li>Polyjet Photopolymer Resin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plastic 3D printers come in two main types - FDM thermoplastic and PolyJet photopolymer resin. FDM printers work by heating and extruding thermoplastic filament layer by layer to create a final object. On the other hand, PolyJet printers use photopolymer resin which is cured by UV light to solidify each layer. FDM printers are more commonly used due to their cost-effectiveness and easy usability, while PolyJet printers are preferred for their ability to produce highly detailed and smooth prints.</p></p>
