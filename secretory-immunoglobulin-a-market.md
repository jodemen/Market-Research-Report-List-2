<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Secretory Immunoglobulin A Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IgA1</li><li>IgA2</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Secretory Immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is the main type of antibody found in mucosal secretions such as saliva, tears, and nasal mucus. There are two subclasses of SIgA: IgA1 and IgA2. IgA1 is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract, while IgA2 is more prevalent in the respiratory tract. Both subclasses play a crucial role in immune defense at mucosal surfaces by neutralizing pathogens and preventing them from entering the body. The differences in distribution of IgA1 and IgA2 reflect their specialization in providing protection in different mucosal environments.</p></p>
