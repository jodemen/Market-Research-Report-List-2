<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Slot Photoelectric Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Separate</li><li>Compact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Slot photoelectric sensors come in two main types: separate and compact. Separate slot sensors consist of a separate emitter and receiver which are installed opposite each other, allowing for longer sensing distances. On the other hand, compact slot sensors combine the emitter and receiver in a single housing, making them more suitable for applications with limited space. Both types offer reliable detection capabilities and are widely used in industrial automation for detecting objects passing through the slot.</p></p>
