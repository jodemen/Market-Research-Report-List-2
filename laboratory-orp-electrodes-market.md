<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory ORP Electrodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Junction</li><li>Double Junction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory ORP electrodes can be classified into two main types: Single Junction and Double Junction. Single Junction electrodes have one junction where the reference solution comes in contact with the sample, making them more prone to contamination and clogging. Double Junction electrodes have an additional junction that isolates the reference solution from the sample, resulting in more accurate and stable measurements. Double Junction electrodes are generally preferred for more demanding laboratory applications where accuracy is crucial.</p></p>
