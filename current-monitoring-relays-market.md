<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Current Monitoring Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Under-Current Detection</li><li>Over-Current Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Current monitoring relays are devices used to monitor the flow of electrical currents in a system. There are two main types in the market - under-current detection and over-current detection. Under-current detection relays are designed to detect when the current falls below a certain threshold, indicating a fault or malfunction. On the other hand, over-current detection relays are used to identify when the current exceeds a set limit, which could potentially lead to equipment damage or safety hazards. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and safety of electrical systems.</p></p>
