<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Blast Cabinet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Blast Cabinet</li><li>Suction Blast Cabinet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic blast cabinets are categorized into two main types: Pressure Blast Cabinet and Suction Blast Cabinet. Pressure Blast Cabinets use high-pressure air and abrasive media to remove surface contaminants or coatings from materials. They are more powerful and efficient but also more expensive. On the other hand, Suction Blast Cabinets use the venturi principle to create suction which pulls abrasive media into the airstream for cleaning. They are less powerful and cost-effective compared to Pressure Blast Cabinets. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different industrial applications based on the requirement.</p></p>
